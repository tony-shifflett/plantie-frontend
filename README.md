# Code Snippets

```
//reducer function takes in an action and returns new state based on that action
const plantReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {

    //switch statement to check action.type, which describes what happens to state
    switch (action.type) {
        //add returns new state that includes existing state + payload
        case 'add':
            return [...state, action.payload]
        //remove uses a filter function to return all objects in state - the plant being removed
        case 'remove':
            return state.filter((aPlant)=>aPlant._id !==action.payload._id)

        //get state from database 
        case 'get':
            return action.payload

        //default returns current state
        default: 
            return state;
    }
}
```
Filter Form
```
    const handleChange = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setFilteredPlants(plants.filter(p => p.type.toLowerCase().includes(e.target.value.toLowerCase()) || p.binomial.toLowerCase().includes(e.target.value.toLowerCase())))
  }
```
